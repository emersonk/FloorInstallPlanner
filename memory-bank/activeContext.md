## Purpose
Tracks current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

---

### Current Work Focus
Establishing initial documentation, architecture, and workflow for the FloorInstallPlanner project. Setting up memory bank files and planning the first implementation steps.

### Recent Changes
- Created `progress.md` to track project status.
- Reviewed and scaffolded all memory bank files.
- Outlined initial project plan and documentation-first workflow.

### Next Steps
- Define the JSON input schema and create an example file in the public directory.
- Document initial architecture and technology stack.
- Plan and scaffold the TypeScript layout engine.
- Set up Astro/CSS grid rendering for the visualization.
- Update memory bank files as work progresses.

### Active Decisions & Considerations
- Use AstroJS for static site generation.
- Use TypeScript for the layout engine.
- Use CSS grid for visualization.
- All input dimensions in mm.
- Documentation-first, memory bank-driven workflow.

### Important Patterns & Preferences
- Modular, well-documented code.
- Clear separation between data (JSON), logic (TypeScript), and presentation (Astro/CSS).
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the memory bank.

### Learnings & Project Insights
- Early documentation clarifies requirements and constraints.
- A strong foundation in architecture and workflow will accelerate future development.
