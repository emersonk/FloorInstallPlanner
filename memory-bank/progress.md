## Purpose
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

---

### What Works
- Project repository and AstroJS scaffold are set up.
- Memory bank documentation structure is in place.
- TypeScript engine outputs a grid of planks and expansion gaps.
- Color-coded, labeled CSS grid visualization is live and matches input parameters.

### What's Left to Build
- Implement additional installation constraints (e.g., butt joint offset, min plank length, min first/last row width).
- Enhance visualization: improved styling.
- Document visualization approach and grid structure in systemPatterns.md.
- Continue to update memory bank and documentation as features are added.

### Current Status
- Visualization milestone complete: grid renders with correct color-coding and legend.
- Input parameters are parsed and displayed; grid structure matches room and plank dimensions.
- Ready to implement more advanced layout logic and user-facing features.

### Known Issues
- None at this stage.

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use AstroJS, TypeScript, and CSS grid for a static visualization tool.
- Documentation-first workflow established using the memory bank.
