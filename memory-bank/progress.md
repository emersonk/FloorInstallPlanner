## Purpose
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

---

### What Works
- Project repository and AstroJS scaffold are set up.
- Memory bank documentation structure is in place.
- TypeScript engine outputs a grid of planks and expansion gaps.
- Interactive, stepwise plank laying: the grid starts empty, and planks are revealed one by one in lay order via a button.
- Each plank displays its dimensions and the order it was laid, inside the cell.
- All core installation constraints (min plank length, min first/last row width, min butt joint offset) are implemented in the layout engine.
- Visualization is minimal: no color coding or legend, just clear plank info and interactive reveal.
- Astro Islands and vanilla JS are used for targeted client-side interactivity.

### What's Left to Build
- Normalize the grid data so all rows have the same number of cells, or update the layout engine to ensure consistent row lengths (to fix the grey area in the visualization).
- Consider further UI/UX polish (e.g., animation, progress indicator, reset button).
- Gather user feedback for additional features or improvements.
- Continue to update memory bank and documentation as features are added or changed.
- Review and refactor code for clarity and maintainability.

### Current Status
- Debugging a persistent grey area in the grid visualization. Discovered that the issue is not with page layout or CSS, but with the grid data: some rows in the grid have fewer cells than others, causing the CSS grid to render empty columns with a grey background.
- The project now features an interactive, minimal, stepwise visualization of plank installation.
- All planks start hidden; the user reveals them one by one in lay order.
- No color coding or legend is present; each plank displays its dimensions and lay order.
- All core installation constraints are implemented in the layout engine.
- No known issues at this stage.

### Known Issues
- Grey area appears in the grid visualization when some rows in the grid data have fewer cells than others. This causes the CSS grid to render empty columns with a grey background. The root cause is inconsistent row lengths in the grid data, not a layout or CSS issue.

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use AstroJS, TypeScript, and CSS grid for a static, color-coded visualization tool.
- Moved to a documentation-first workflow using the memory bank.
- Evolved from static, color-coded visualization to interactive, stepwise plank laying using Astro Islands and vanilla JS, with a focus on clarity and minimalism.
