# progress.md

## Purpose
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

---

### What Works
- Project repository and AstroJS scaffold are set up.
- Memory bank documentation structure is in place.
- TypeScript engine outputs a grid of planks and expansion gaps.
- Color-coded, labeled CSS grid visualization is live and matches input parameters.
- All core installation constraints (min plank length, min first/last row width, min butt joint offset) are implemented and visualized.

### What's Left to Build
- Review and refactor code for clarity and maintainability.
- Add or improve tooltips, labels, and summary statistics if desired.
- Document completed constraint logic and visualization in systemPatterns.md.
- Continue to update memory bank and documentation as features are added.

### Current Status
- All core installation constraints are implemented and visualized in the grid.
- Visualization highlights violations of min plank length, min first/last row width, and min butt joint offset.
- Project is ready for code review, refactoring, and further enhancements or testing.

### Known Issues
- None at this stage.

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use AstroJS, TypeScript, and CSS grid for a static visualization tool.
- Documentation-first workflow established using the memory bank.
